# Issue and Pull Request Guidelines

Thank you for helping make rawr better!


## Issues

If you're reporting an issue, it must contain:

* Example code that reproduces the **observed** behavior.
* An explanation of what the **expected** behavior is.



## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed. 

If you create a function to retrieve R code from another website, please follow these conventions

* The function should be named according the name of the website (e.g. if the function retrives R code from `www.example.com`, it should be called `example()`), unless there's a very sensible reason to deviate
* Please ensure the __intent__ of your contribution is clear.
