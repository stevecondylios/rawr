`rawr` helps you quickly grab R code from the web, either straight to an R file, or to your clipboard. This avoids tedious copy/pasting of code from browser to IDE.

### R Code from Popular R websites

Retrieve R code from a website to your clipboard with `rawr_to_clip()`, here are some examples:

```R
# install.packages("rawr")
library(rawr)

# CRAN vignettes
rawr_to_clip("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/topic_modeling.html")

# Stack Overflow
rawr_to_clip("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58248102/date-input-dt-r-shiny")

# Kaggle
rawr_to_clip("https://www.kaggle.com/vrtjso/mercari-eda-more-info-than-you-can-imagine")

# Datacamp
rawr_to_clip("https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-R")

# GitHub 
rawr_to_clip("https://github.com/hadley/vis-eda/blob/master/travel.R")

# Jupyter Notebook on GitHub
rawr_to_clip("https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/blob/master/Jupyter/SIT742P10B-MLSystem.ipynb")

# Blogdown sites
rawr_to_clip("https://www.jtimm.net/2019/04/14/lexical-change-procrustes/")

``` 


### Other functionality

Write output to a temp file

```R
rawr("https://www.kaggle.com/vrtjso/mercari-eda-more-info-than-you-can-imagine", to_file=T)
```

Write output to a specific file

```R
rawr("https://www.kaggle.com/vrtjso/mercari-eda-more-info-than-you-can-imagine", file_path="mynewfile.R")
```

Some sites have > 1 way of identifying R coode. If `rawr()` returns no result 
(or if the result is non-sense), try another `method`

```R
"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/keras-r-deep-learning" %>% rawr %>% cat
# no result

"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/keras-r-deep-learning" %>% rawr(method = 2) %>% cat 
# returns correct output
```
